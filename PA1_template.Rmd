## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r, echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv(file = "activity.csv", header =  TRUE)  # loading the data

```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r, echo=TRUE}
grp_df <- group_by(act_df, date)
grp_df <- summarise(grp_df, sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
names(grp_df)[2] <- "total_steps"
steps_mean <- mean(grp_df$total_steps)
steps_median <- median(grp_df$total_steps)

steps_mean
steps_median

```
```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(grp_df$total_steps, xlab = "Total number of steps in a day", ylab = "Number of days", col = "green")
abline(v = steps_median, col = "red")
abline(v = steps_mean, col = "blue")

```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
